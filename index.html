            <p> Bali is one of the most talked-about travel destinations in the world, and for good reason. With hip
                beach towns,
                traditional villages, a couple of volcanoes, and even a few smaller islands off the coast, there are
                plenty of
                places to visit in Bali.</p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="basetitle">1. Seminyak</h2>
            <div align="center">
                <img class="baseimg"
                    src="https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/seminyak-beach-bali.jpg"
                    alt="Seminyak">
            </div>
            <p>One of the best places to visit in Bali is the trendy and stylish beach town of Seminyak. It’s just north
                of the chaos of Kuta-Legian, but it feels worlds apart. Here you’ll find boutique hotels and swanky
                villas as well as some excellent dining, shopping, and nightlife.</p>
            <p>While the town itself is nice, the highlight of Seminyak is definitely Double 6 Beach.</p>
            <p>The waves are mild here, so it’s a good spot for swimming, boogie-boarding, and surfing. It’s the perfect
                place for beginners and there are plenty of surf schools around to help you start carving up waves.
                After all, surfing is huge here in Bali. </p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="basetitle">2. Ubud</h2>
            <div align="center">
                <img class="baseimg"
                    src="https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/where-to-go-in-bali-visit-ubud.jpg"
                    alt="Ubud">
            </div>
            <p>OOur next stop is the cultural and spiritual heart of Bali — Ubud.</p>
            <p>Located about an hour north of the capital, this is actually a cluster of different villages that are
                each run by their own local committee (known as banjar in Indonesian). For the purpose of travel,
                though, it’s easier to just refer to the whole area as Ubud.</p>
            <p>In the central part of town, you’ll find the Ubud Palace and the market. This corner is often clogged
                with day-trippers and a seemingly never-ending stream of taxi drivers and touts. If it’s a bit of peace
                and quiet you seek, you’ll have to dig a little deeper in Ubud! </p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="basetitle">3. Canggu</h2>
            <div align="center">
                <img class="baseimg"
                    src="https://www.goatsontheroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/best-places-to-visit-in-bali-canggu-for-surfing.jpg"
                    alt="Canggu">
            </div>
            <p>Next up on our list of where to go in Bali is Canggu. This town has long been popular with surfers but is
                starting to attract more visitors and digital nomads.</p>
            <p>Since the beaches here are grey or black sand and the waves can be a bit rough, you won’t find huge
                crowds of tourists or touts here.</p>
            
            <p>It’s nice being able to kick back in a beach chair and crack an ice-cold Bintang without being swarmed by
                people trying to sell you sarongs. The breaks in Canggu are great for more advanced surfers or for a bit
                of extreme boogie-boarding. </p>
