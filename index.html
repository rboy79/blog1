    <p> Bali is one of the most talked-about travel destinations in the world, and for good reason. With hip beach towns,
        traditional villages, a couple of volcanoes, and even a few smaller islands off the coast, there are plenty of
        places to visit in Bali.

        While Bali may look a bit unassuming on the map next to gargantuan Java – the most populous island of Indonesia
        and home to the capital of Jakarta – there’s a lot going on here.

        A quick ride can bring you from a bustling tourist hot spot to a tranquil Hindu temple in the rice fields. Or
        perhaps you’d rather cool off with a swim in a rushing waterfall. There are countless things to do in Bali to
        keep you busy!
